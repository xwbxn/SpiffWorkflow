What is SpiffWorkflow?
======================


SpiffWorkflow allows your python application to process BPMN diagrams (think
of them as very powerful flow charts,  See :doc:`/bpmn/intro`.) to accomplish
what would otherwise require writing a lot of complex business logic in your
code. You can use these diagrams to accomplish a number of tasks, such as:

 - Creating a questionnaire with multiple complex paths
 - Implement an approval process that requires input from multiple users
 - Allow non-programmers to modify the flow and behavior of your application.

SpiffWorkflow is based on the excellent work of the
`Workflow Patterns initiative <http://www.workflowpatterns.com/>`_.
Its main design goals are the following:

- Directly support as many of the patterns of workflowpatterns.com as possible.
- Map those patterns into workflow elements that are easy to understand by a user in a workflow GUI editor.
- Provide a clean Python API.

You can find a list of supported workflow patterns in :ref:`features`.
