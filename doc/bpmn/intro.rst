Overview of BPMN
============================

To use SpiffWorkflow, you need at least a basic understanding of BPMN.
This page offers a brief overview. There are many resources for additional
information about BPMN.

In these examples and throughout the documentation we use the a Modeler for
BPMN. `BPMN.js <https://bpmn.io/toolkit/bpmn-js/>`  To support web forms
we use Camunda's free BPMN editor.


.. sidebar:: BPMN Modelers

  There are a number of modelers in existence, and any BPMN compliant modeler should work.
  SpiffWorkflow has some basic support for the free Camunda modeler, to use it's form building
  capabilities, but we intend to encapsulate this support in an extension module and remove
  it from the core library eventually.  It does help for making some examples and demonstrating
  how one might implement user tasks in an online environment.

A Simple Workflow
-----------------

All BPMN models have a start event and at least one end event. The start event
is represented with a single thin border circle. An end event is represented
by a single thick border circle.

The following example also has one task, represented by the rectangle with curved corners.

   A simple workflow.


The sequence flow is represented with a solid line connector. When the node at
the tail of a sequence flow completes, the node  at the arrowhead is enabled to start.


More complicated Workflow
-------------------------

   A workflow with a gateway


In this example, the diamond shape is called a gateway. It represents a branch
point in our flow.  This gateway is an exclusive data-based  gateway (also
called an XOR gateway). With an exclusive gateway, you must take one path or
the other based on some data condition. BPMN has other gateway types.

The important point is that we can use a gateway to add a branch in the
workflow **without** creating an explicit branch in our Python code.


.. sidebar:: BPMN Resources

  This guide is a mere introduction to how to get started with BPMN allowing someone to get started with
  SpiffWorkflow and start using it to write programs that perform a workflow and let SpiffWorkflow do the heavy lifting.
  For a more serious modeling, we recommend looking for more comprehensive resources. We have used the books by Bruce
  Silver as a guide for our BPMN modeling.
