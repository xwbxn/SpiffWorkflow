Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)
==========================================

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a diagramming language for
business process flows. BPMN links the realms of business and IT, and creates
a common process language that can be shared between the two.

BPMN describes details of process behaviors efficiently in a diagram. The
meaning is precise enough to describe the technical details that control
process execution in an automation engine. SpiffWorkflow allows you to create
code to get a BPMN up and running.

When using SpiffWorkflow, a client can manipulate the BPMN diagram and still
have their product work without a need for you to edit the Python code,
improving response and turnaround time.

Today, nearly every process modeling tool supports BPMN in some fashion making
it a great tool to learn and use.
